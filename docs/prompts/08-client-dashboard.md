## Description
Build the main entry point for the post-wizard experience. The Overview tab aggregates data from the wizard (Project creation) and displays health metrics, recent activity, and an "AI Advisor" panel.

## Goals
- Create the Dashboard Layout (similar to Wizard but focused on Management).
- Implement "Health Metrics Row": Score, Tasks, Budget, Risk.
- Build "Attention Items" feed (blockers, approvals).
- Build "Recent Activity" feed (database real-time subscriptions).
- Implement "AI Advisor" panel (Right side) offering proactive insights.

```

## Success Criteria
- Dashboard loads project data generated by the Wizard.
- Health Score is visually distinct (Green/Yellow/Red).
- Real-time updates when tasks/phases change status.
- Responsive design handles the 3-column layout on desktop and stacked on mobile.
